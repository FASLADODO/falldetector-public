# Thesis - Fall detection - Work in progress

This is Kim Salmi's thesis for Haaga-Helia UAS. The thesis proposes an automatic monitoring system for formal and informal home care patients and care centers. It will provide security and a feeling of safety by detecting when a resident fall. After the detection the system will be able to alert professional personnel or family. The system should be affordable and should not be significantly less accurate than other available options.
